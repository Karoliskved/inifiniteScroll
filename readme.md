App was made using react

USAGE GUIDE

run command "npm run dev" in the project folder to run the program. It should display the port where the app is running, copy and paste it to the browser and it's good to go
the app doesn't load anything on the initial render, scroll down to start loading data.

Implemented features:

- calls pexels API asynchronously for data using fetch
- infinite scroll: loads more data while scrolling down
- reactive design: different css styling for phones, tablets and desktop
- hover state for photos
- option to favorite an item: favorited items have a different button design, favorited photos are saved on reload by using local storage
